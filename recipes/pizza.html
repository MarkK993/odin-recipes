    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Well this doesn't look like a normal pizza and that's because it isn't, it's pizza with grapes and lot more crazy
        stuff, but trust me its more than delicious.</p>
    <p>This is a pretty straight forward recipe of course with few crazy (but unimaginably tasty twists), just get your
        ingredients and be ready for a crazy ride! </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>150 g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>2 higher-welfare Cumberland or veggie sausages</li>
        <li>1 small red onion</li>
        <li>1 spring of rosemary</li>
        <li>1 heaped tablespoon sun-dried tomato paste</li>
        <li>100 g red seedless grapes</li>
        <li>1 x 125 g ball of mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon pine nuts</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to full whack (240ÂºC).</li>
        <li>Pile the flour into a bowl with a small pinch of sea salt, add 80ml of water and mix into a dough, then
            knead on a flour-dusted surface for 2 minutes, adding a little extra flour, if needed. Roll and stretch out
            into a large oval (about 15cm x 30cm), then place in a large sturdy oiled tray.</li>
        <li>Cover with a clean damp tea towel and leave to rest while you put a small non-stick frying pan on a
            medium-high heat, then squeeze balls of sausage meat out of the skins into the pan (if using veggie
            sausages,
            roughly slice and use 1 tablespoon of olive oil for frying). Fry until golden all over, tossing regularly,
            while you peel the red onion and slice super finely, ideally on a mandolin (use the guard!).</li>
        <li>Pick the rosemary leaves and toss with the onion, a pinch of sea salt and black pepper and 1 tablespoon of
            oil until well coated.</li>
        <li>Spread the tomato paste over the dough, sprinkle over the dressed red onion, and spoon over the sausage
            balls.</li>
        <li>Toss the grapes into the pan for 1 minute, then spoon over the pizza with any juices, tear over the
            mozzarella and sprinkle with the pine nuts.</li>
        <li>Place the tray over a high heat on the hob until it starts to sizzle, then cook at the bottom of the oven
            for 10 minutes, or until golden and crisp.</li>
    </ol>
