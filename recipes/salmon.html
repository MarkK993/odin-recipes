    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Amazingly crispy salmon with a Spanish chorizo and mixed cherries that give it amazing flavor</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 x 150 g salmon fillets , skin on, scaled, pin-boned, from sustainable sources</li>
        <li>300 g ripe mixed-colour cherry tomatoes </li>
        <li>300 g ripe mixed-colour cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>4 sprigs of fresh basil</li>
        <li>8 black olives , (stone in)</li>
        <li>30 g higher-welfare chorizo</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the salmon flesh side down in a large cold non-stick frying pan and place on a medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>As the pan comes up to temperature and the salmon begins to sizzle (about 3 minutes), flip it over and cook
            on the skin side for 5 minutes, or until very crisp and just cooked (depending on its thickness).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, halve the cherry tomatoes, tear up most of the basil leaves, then toss it all with 1 tablespoon
            of red wine vinegar and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Squash the olives and discard the stones, then finely chop the flesh. Mix with 1 teaspoon of extra virgin
            olive oil and a splash of water. </li>
        <li>Finely slice the chorizo, add to the pan for the last 2 minutes, then toss in the dressed tomatoes for 30
            seconds.</li>
        <li>Divide between your plates, with the salmon on top. Spoon over the dressed olives and pick over the
            remaining basil. </li>
    </ol>
